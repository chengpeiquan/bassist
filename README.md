# With Types

No need to install the `@types/**` package anymore.

## Why?

I got tired of having to install an additional `@types/**` package every time in my TypeScript project to support type inference for these utilities.

So I merged them, but in fact, after installing this package, the original package will still be installed implicitly, and all functions are provided by the original package.

## Supported utilities
